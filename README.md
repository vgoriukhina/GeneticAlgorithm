# Genetic Algorythm README
A console project demonstrating the application of a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem. 
The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, the goal is to determine 
the best combination of items to include in a knapsack of limited capacity, maximizing the total value while not exceeding the weight limit. 
This project showcases how a genetic algorithm, inspired by the process of natural selection, can be employed to efficiently find near-optimal 
solutions to this NP-hard problem.
